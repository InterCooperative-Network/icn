## Installation & Upgrade

To install or upgrade to ICN v0.9.0:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/example/icn.git

## Getting Started

See the following documentation to get started:

- [RUNTIME_OVERVIEW.md](docs/RUNTIME_OVERVIEW.md) - Understanding the runtime architecture
- [WALLET_OVERVIEW.md](docs/WALLET_OVERVIEW.md) - Wallet capabilities and features
- [FEDERATION_LAUNCH.md](docs/FEDERATION_LAUNCH.md) - Creating and operating a federation

## Known Issues

- Integration tests require a PostgreSQL database when run without `SQLX_OFFLINE=true`
- Some Windows-specific path handling may need improvements
- Execution receipt sharing across federation boundaries requires additional verification

## Future Work

- Federation performance benchmarking and optimization
- Enhanced security auditing and verification
- Mobile wallet support
- Additional federation governance models
- External system integrations
