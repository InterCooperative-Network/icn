# CCL Interpreter Implementation Summary

## What We've Accomplished

1. **Fixed the CCL Parser Grammar**:
   - Updated the grammar to properly support versioned templates (e.g., `coop_bylaws:v2`)
   - Enhanced the parser to extract both template type and version information
   - All tests for template versioning now pass

2. **Identified and Documented Core VM Issues**:
   - Created `fix-core-vm-errors.md` documenting the issues with the core-vm module
   - Identified multiple issues related to outdated wasmtime API usage
   - Suggested fixes for each issue (Clone trait, Trap::throw, etc.)
   - Created a temporary workaround to allow development without fixing core-vm first

3. **Implemented and Tested AST Interpretation**:
   - Enhanced the CclInterpreter to properly validate templates based on scope
   - Added processing of nested structures in CCL documents
   - Added proper error handling for type mismatches, missing fields, etc.
   - Implemented comprehensive tests for all interpreter functionality

## Current Status

The governance-kernel now successfully:
- Parses CCL documents into an AST representation
- Validates the template type against the execution scope
- Processes the AST into a structured governance configuration
- Validates all required fields based on template type
- Supports versioned templates (e.g., `coop_bylaws:v2`)

All tests are passing when the core-vm dependency is temporarily disabled.

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Core VM Issues**:
   - Apply the fixes documented in `fix-core-vm-errors.md`
   - Update wasmtime usage to be compatible with the latest version
   - Implement Clone for ConcreteHostEnvironment
   - Fix all Trap::new usages to use Trap::throw

2. **Complete CCL to WASM Compilation**:
   - Implement the compilation step from validated CCL to WASM modules
   - Add validation tests for the generated WASM modules
   - Integrate with the core-vm for actual execution

3. **Add Additional Templates**:
   - Implement more template types beyond coop_bylaws
   - Add template-specific validation logic
   - Support upgrading between template versions
