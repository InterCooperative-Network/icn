# DAG System

## Overview

The DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) System is the core data structure implementation for the ICN Runtime. It provides a foundation for representing causal relationships between operations, enabling non-blocking concurrent processing while maintaining a verifiable audit trail.

## Key Components

### DAG Node

The core structure representing a single operation in the DAG:

```rust
pub struct DagNode {
    /// IPLD payload data
    pub payload: Ipld,
    
    /// Parent CIDs
    pub parents: Vec<Cid>,
    
    /// Identity of the issuer
    pub issuer: IdentityId,
    
    /// Signature over the node content
    pub signature: Vec<u8>,
    
    /// Metadata
    pub metadata: DagNodeMetadata,
}
```

### DAG Manager

Interface for DAG operations:

```rust
pub trait DagManager: Send + Sync {
    /// Store a new DAG node
    async fn store_node(&self, node: &DagNode) -> Result<Cid>;
    
    /// Retrieve a DAG node by CID
    async fn get_node(&self, cid: &Cid) -> Result<Option<DagNode>>;
    
    /// Get the latest nodes in the DAG (tips)
    async fn get_tips(&self) -> Result<Vec<Cid>>;
    
    // Additional methods...
}
```

### Node Builder

Fluent API for constructing DAG nodes:

```rust
let node = DagNodeBuilder::new()
    .payload(ipld!({ "key": "value" }))
    .parent(parent_cid)
    .issuer(identity_id)
    .tag("governance")
    .build()?;
```

## Architectural Tenets

- **Append-Only**: All state lives in append-only Merkle-anchored DAG objects
- **Content-Addressed**: Uses CIDs (Content Identifiers) for integrity verification
- **Causal**: Maintains explicit causal relationships between operations
- **Non-Blocking**: Enables concurrent operations without blocking consensus
- **Verifiable**: All operations include signatures for authentication and non-repudiation

## Usage Context

The DAG System is used in ICN for:

1. **Governance Operations**: Proposals, votes, and appeals
2. **Credential Management**: Issuance and revocation of verifiable credentials
3. **Federation State**: Tracking federation configuration and trust bundles
4. **Cross-Federation Trust**: Anchoring and verifying state across federation boundaries

## Development Status

This module is stable and fully tested. Future work includes:

- Performance optimizations for large DAGs
- Advanced query capabilities for complex traversals
- Pruning strategies for archival nodes
