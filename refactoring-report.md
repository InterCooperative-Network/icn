# ICN Core-VM Refactoring Report

## Completed Changes

1. **Fixed Trap::new Usages**
   - Replaced all `Trap::new` with `Trap::throw` in host_abi.rs
   - This brings the error handling in line with wasmtime 12.0.2 requirements

2. **Added Wallet-Runtime Compatibility Layer**
   - Created a new wallet-sync crate with a compatibility layer for wallet and runtime integration
   - Implemented conversion functions for DAG nodes between wallet and runtime formats
   - Added dependency on wallet-sync in core-vm to enable direct conversion

## Verified No Changes Needed

1. **Memory Access Methods**
   - The `get_memory` function in mem_helpers.rs is already using the correct API
   - It uses `caller.get_export("memory")` directly rather than through `as_context_mut()`

2. **ConcreteHostEnvironment Clone Trait**
   - The `ConcreteHostEnvironment` struct already has the `#[derive(Clone)]` attribute

## Benefits of Changes

1. **Improved Error Handling**
   - More consistent error handling with wasmtime 12.0.2
   - Better error information propagation through the stack

2. **Better Type Safety in Wallet-Runtime Integration**
   - Clear separation of wallet and runtime data structures
   - Explicit conversion functions prevent accidental misuse
   - Support for legacy wallet formats ensures backward compatibility

## Remaining Issues

1. **Update Library Documentation**
   - The core-vm documentation should be updated to reflect the new error handling patterns
   - Add examples for using the wallet-sync compatibility layer

2. **Test Coverage**
   - Add comprehensive tests for the compatibility layer
   - Ensure all edge cases in conversion are properly handled

## Next Steps

1. **Integration Testing**
   - Test the wallet-runtime integration with real data
   - Verify that all components work together correctly

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Profile the conversion functions to identify any performance bottlenecks
   - Optimize the conversion process if needed
