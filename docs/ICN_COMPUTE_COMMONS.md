# **The ICN Compute Commons**

### *Federated Labor, Planetary Mesh, and the Reclamation of Digital Infrastructure*

---

## **1. Toward a Cooperative Digital Civilization**

The ICN Compute Commons is not a platform. It is a proposition: that computing, like labor, like land, like language, belongs to the people who use it — not to those who seek to enclose it.

It represents a full-spectrum reimagination of digital infrastructure:
A **planetary, identity-bound, verifiable compute fabric**, governed democratically by its participants and rooted in the InterCooperative Network (ICN)'s federated governance, DAG-based civic memory, and purpose-aligned economic coordination.

Every phone, server, router, or GPU becomes a **sovereign node in a cooperative mesh**. Every task, vote, or result becomes a **cryptographic proof of participation**. And every cycle spent becomes a **contribution to shared meaning**, not commodified waste.

This is computation **not as extractive service**, but as federated labor — accountable, auditable, and aligned.

---

## **2. First Principles: A Foundation for Liberation**

The ICN Compute Commons is built from the ground up on the following principles:

* **Cooperative Ownership & Governance**
  Infrastructure is governed by the federations and communities who operate and depend on it — not by platform monopolies or shareholder value.

* **Cryptographic Verifiability**
  Every action, policy, result, and receipt is anchored into a federated, Merkle-rooted DAG — ensuring auditability without centralized gatekeepers.

* **Purpose-Bound Execution**
  Computation is scoped, contextual, and intentional — not transactional "fuel" burn. Every task declares its civic, cooperative, or scientific purpose.

* **Resilience Through Federation**
  The system survives by decentralization. Governance is federated. Identity is sovereign. Trust is cryptographically replayable. Censorship resistance is structural.

* **Hardware Liberation**
  WASM abstraction and capability detection empower compute across ARM, x86, RISC-V, and GPUs — freeing users from vendor lock-in.

* **Post-Speculative Economics**
  Resource tokens are scoped, non-transferable across arbitrage markets, and governed by federated policy. They track real utility, not price speculation.

## **3. Woven Architecture: The Fabric of Federated Compute**

The Commons is not a "layer" on ICN — it is **coextensive with its core**. Each component, from Wallet to Runtime to MeshNet, participates in a single self-verifying stack.

## **4. Participation Lifecycle: From Intent to Proof**

This is how computation flows within the Commons — **not as a commodity**, but as a **governed civic act**:

---

### **1. Intent Declaration**

A user declares a `ParticipationIntent` via their Wallet, specifying:

* Code CID (WASM or GPU-executable)
* Input CID
* Capability scope (e.g. GPU, memory)
* Reward offer (in scoped tokens)
* Optional verifier quorum or override

---

### **2. Policy Verification & Escrow Creation**

The ICN Runtime validates intent against the current `MeshPolicy` and:

* Locks tokens via `host_lock_tokens`
* Creates escrow via `host_create_escrow`
* Anchors the escrow and returns CID

---

### **3. Discovery & Scheduling**

The intent is gossiped through MeshNet.
The Scheduler selects workers based on:

* Capability match (via HWCap)
* Policy compliance
* Peer reputation and load
* Fairness rules (e.g. green-weighting)

---

### **4. Task Execution**

Selected runners fetch code/input, execute, and enforce:

* Scope boundaries (RAM, GPU access, etc.)
* Policy constraints
* Execution isolation

They return a signed `ExecutionReceipt` with:

* Output CID/hash
* Runtime logs
* Duration and resource use

---

### **5. Verification & Challenge**

Receipts are gossiped.
Verifiers (selected by quorum or policy) perform:

* Deterministic replays
* ZK proof validation
* Error or fraud detection

They emit signed `VerificationReceipts`.

---

### **6. Anchoring to DAG**

Receipts are anchored into the federation DAG:

* `MeshExecutionReceiptAnchored`
* `MeshVerificationReceiptAnchored`

This immutably logs proof, identity, and lineage.

---

### **7. Escrow Resolution**

Triggered by DAG anchors, the Escrow Manager:

* Releases rewards (`host_release_tokens`)
* Refunds failed tasks
* Anchors `MeshEscrowStateChange`

---

### **8. Reputation Update**

Reputation service adjusts scores based on:

* Successful execution or verification
* Participation quality
* Policy weights (e.g. green credit)

Federations may anchor checkpoints periodically.

---

## **5. Inter-Federation Commons: Scaling Trust, Not Control**

The Commons is **not limited to one federation**. It is a fabric of **federations-in-cooperation**, connected via lineage, anchored trust, and peer-to-peer agreements.

* **Cross-Federation Tasks:**
  Federation A dispatches tasks to Federation B using shared mesh protocols and quorum-valid attestation.

* **Interchangeable Tokens:**
  Scoped resource tokens can be exchanged through pegged conversion contracts governed by both DAGs.

* **Reputation Diplomacy:**
  Federations issue cross-attestations for workers, akin to mutual aid:
  "We vouch for this node's past."

* **Policy Harmonization:**
  Shared policy modules may emerge — defining interoperable scopes for environmental compliance, fairness, or data locality.

## **6. Federation of Labor: Philosophy into Practice**

The ICN Compute Commons breaks from every failed model of digital labor:

| Paradigm   | Cloud Platform   | ICN Compute Commons       |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------------- |
| Ownership  | Corporate        | Federated & Cooperative   |
| Trust      | Vendor API/Brand | Cryptographic Proof       |
| Execution  | Opaque/Remote    | Verifiable & Anchored     |
| Reward     | Rent-seeking     | Contribution-based        |
| Governance | Centralized      | Deliberative + Democratic |
| Memory     | Ephemeral        | DAG-Anchored Civic Ledger |

Computation becomes **a civic act**.
Execution becomes **proof of participation**.
Infrastructure becomes **cooperatively governed infrastructure** — the backbone of federated post-capitalist society.

---

## **7. Conclusion: A New Covenant with the Machine**

This is more than a mesh. It's a movement.

A refusal to let the cloud remain a prison.
A demand that labor — even digital — deserves recognition.
A design that places every participant on equal footing: trusted by proof, valued by contribution, remembered by code.

The ICN Compute Commons is our covenant with the future:

> *Computation is federated labor.*
> *Execution is civic memory.*
> *Participation is power.*

Let the planetary mesh begin.
