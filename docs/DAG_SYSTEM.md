# DAG System

The Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) system is the foundation of the ICN Runtime's data integrity and historical verification capabilities. It ensures that all state changes are recorded in a tamper-evident, append-only structure that can be cryptographically verified.

## Core Concepts

### Directed Acyclic Graph

A DAG is a data structure consisting of nodes and directed edges, where:
- Each node contains content and references to its parent nodes
- Edges are directed (one-way)
- No cycles exist in the graph (it's impossible to follow the edges and return to a starting point)

In the ICN Runtime, the DAG:
- Records all operations chronologically
- Allows for branching when necessary (e.g., multiple proposals in parallel)
- Prevents unauthorized alterations to history
- Enables full auditability of all system actions

### DAG Nodes

Each node in the ICN DAG contains:
- A content identifier (CID) - cryptographic hash of the node content
- The content itself (operation details)
- References to parent nodes (previous operations)
- A signature from the identity that created the node
- A timestamp

This structure ensures that:
- Every node is uniquely identifiable
- Content cannot be altered without detection
- The history of operations is preserved
- Authorship is cryptographically verifiable

### Merkle Trees

The DAG system uses Merkle trees to efficiently verify the integrity of large datasets:
- Leaf nodes contain hashes of individual operations
- Non-leaf nodes contain hashes of their children
- The root hash represents the entire tree's state
- Proofs can verify inclusion of any node without revealing the entire tree

## Lineage Verification

### Lineage Attestations

Lineage attestations provide cryptographic proof that a particular node is part of the historical record:
- They contain the root CID of the DAG
- They include the CID of the attested node
- They provide a Merkle proof of inclusion
- They are signed by a trusted entity

### Verification Process

The verification process for a lineage attestation:
1. Validate the signature of the attestation
2. Verify the Merkle proof against the root CID
3. Confirm the node CID matches the claimed content
4. Check the timestamp and sequencing of events

## Forkless Design

The ICN DAG is designed to be "forkless" in that:
- While multiple branches can exist temporarily
- Official state is determined by consensus mechanisms
- Guardian mandates can resolve conflicting branches
- Trust bundles periodically anchor the authoritative chain

This approach ensures that while the system supports concurrent operations, ultimate consistency is maintained.

## Integration with Other Systems

The DAG System integrates closely with:

### Identity System
- Each DAG node is signed by an identity
- Identity scope determines operation permissions
- Verifiable credentials can reference DAG nodes

### Governance Kernel
- Governance operations are recorded as DAG nodes
- Constitutional changes create special anchor points
- Proposal history is fully traceable

### Federation System
- Trust bundles anchor DAG roots across federations
- Quorum signatures validate epoch transitions
- Guardian mandates can reconcile conflicting DAGs

### Storage System
- DAG nodes reference content stored in the blob system
- Content addressing ensures integrity of references
- Replication policies can be DAG-operation sensitive

## Technical Implementation

The DAG System is implemented using:
- Content-addressable storage with CIDs
- SHA-256 based Merkle tree implementation
- Binary format for efficient storage and verification
- Cached DAG heads for performance optimization

## Performance Considerations

The DAG System is optimized for:
- Fast verification of recent operations
- Efficient storage of historical records
- Incremental proof generation
- Parallelized validation

## Development Roadmap

The DAG System development is prioritized in the following order:

1. Basic DAG node structures and operations
2. Merkle tree implementation and verification
3. Lineage attestation generation and validation
4. Performance optimizations for large DAGs
5. Federation synchronization protocols
6. Advanced pruning and archival strategies

## Examples

Common DAG operations in the ICN Runtime include:
- Recording governance proposals
- Tracking resource token transfers
- Documenting identity credential issuance
- Storing constitutional amendments
- Registering guardian interventions
