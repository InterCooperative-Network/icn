# ICN Documentation

## Core Concepts & Vision

- [**ICN Compute Commons**](./ICN_COMPUTE_COMMONS.md) - The philosophical and architectural vision for a federated compute infrastructure
- [**Mesh Implementation Guide**](./MESH_IMPLEMENTATION.md) - Technical guide connecting the vision to concrete code implementation
- [**Converting to PDF**](./PDF_INSTRUCTIONS.md) - Instructions for creating presentation-ready PDFs of documentation

## Technical Specifications

- [Mesh Compute Overlay](../mesh/MESH_COMPUTE.md) - Detailed specification of the Mesh Compute system

## Key Components

The ICN Compute Commons consists of several integrated components:

### Identity & Governance
- Federation DAG - Cryptographically verifiable history of all network events
- CCL Contracts - Cooperative Contract Language for governance
- Policy Management - Democratic control of network parameters

### Computation & Economics
- Mesh Network - Peer discovery and task distribution
- Capability-bound Execution - Purpose-aligned resource allocation
- Escrow System - Fair economic incentives for computation
- Reputation System - Quality assessment and participant standing

## Getting Started

1. Explore the [ICN Compute Commons](./ICN_COMPUTE_COMMONS.md) to understand the vision
2. Read the [Mesh Implementation Guide](./MESH_IMPLEMENTATION.md) to see how it's built
3. Examine the code in the following directories:
   - `mesh/` - Core mesh compute implementation
   - `icn-wallet-root/` - User interface for mesh interaction
   - `icn-runtime-root/` - Core runtime for execution and verification
