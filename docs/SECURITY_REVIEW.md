## Security Testing Procedures

### 1. Static Analysis

Run static analysis tools on the codebase:

```bash
# Rust-specific static analysis
cargo clippy -- -D warnings

# Dependency audit
cargo audit

# Custom security lints
cargo dylint security_lints
```

### 2. Fuzz Testing

Perform fuzz testing on critical components:

```bash
# Install cargo-fuzz
cargo install cargo-fuzz

# Run fuzz testing on the parser
cargo fuzz run ccl_parser

# Run fuzz testing on the federation protocol
cargo fuzz run federation_protocol

# Run fuzz testing on the VM host ABI
cargo fuzz run host_abi
```

### 3. Security Scanning

Run security scanners:

```bash
# Run Rust security scanner
cargo audit

# Check for secrets in the codebase
git-secrets --scan

# Scan dependencies for vulnerabilities
cargo deny check
```

### 4. Manual Review

Perform manual security review focusing on:

1. Authentication and authorization logic
2. Cryptographic implementations
3. Input validation
4. Error handling
5. Resource constraints

### 5. Penetration Testing

Conduct penetration testing:

1. Attempt to bypass authorization checks
2. Test resource limit enforcement
3. Attempt to inject malicious WASM modules
4. Try to exploit network protocol vulnerabilities
5. Test for race conditions in concurrent operations

## Security Response Plan

Establish a security response plan:

1. Designate a security response team
2. Create a vulnerability reporting process
3. Define severity levels and response times
4. Establish a patching and update process
5. Develop a communication plan for security incidents

## Final Security Sign-off

- [ ] All security checklist items verified
- [ ] All high and critical security issues addressed
- [ ] Static analysis shows no critical warnings
