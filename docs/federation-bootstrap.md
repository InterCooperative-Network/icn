# Federation Genesis Bootstrap Specification

## Overview

This document specifies the formal protocol for initializing a new federation in the Intercooperative Network (ICN). The Federation Genesis Bootstrap process defines how trust is established, encoded, and anchored at the genesis moment of a federation, forming the root of its verifiable governance and constitutional lineage.

The bootstrap process ensures:

* All founding roles and attestations are cryptographically verifiable.
* The genesis state is replayable, auditable, and anchored in the DAG.
* Future federation participants can verify the legitimacy of the genesis moment without relying on implicit trust.

---

## Phase 1: Guardian Initialization

**Purpose:** Establish a set of founding guardians who will co-sign the initial TrustBundle and serve as constitutional verifiers for the federation genesis.

### Inputs

* N guardian participants (humans or entities) with private key material
* Agreed quorum policy (e.g., threshold or majority scheme)

### Outputs

* `GuardianDID` and `GuardianKeyPair` for each participant
* `GuardianRoleCredential` VCs signed by each guardian, asserting their role
* `GuardianQuorumConfig` struct defining the quorum model

### Security Considerations

* Each guardian must securely generate and store key material
* Guardians must sign each credential independently
* No single guardian may unilaterally act to establish the federation

---

## Phase 2: Federation Identity Establishment

**Purpose:** Define the identity and metadata of the federation and produce the Establishment Credential.

### Inputs

* `FederationName`, `Description`, `Jurisdiction`, optional metadata
* A generated `FederationDID` and associated signing key
* Guardian signatures attesting to legitimacy

### Outputs

* `FederationMetadata` document
* `FederationEstablishmentCredential` VC signed by guardians

### Cryptographic Guarantees

* The FederationEstablishmentCredential is signed by quorum
* The federation DID is deterministically generated or anchored

---

## Phase 3: TrustBundle & Consensus Declaration

**Purpose:** Assemble the canonical TrustBundle that declares the federation's policies, memberships, and signed genesis state.

### Inputs

* Initial policy definitions (e.g., governance config, quorum rules)
* Founding member list (nodes, communities, cooperatives)
* Federation metadata and guardian credentials

### Outputs

* `TrustBundle` (includes `FederationMetadata`, `GuardianQuorumConfig`, `MembershipAttestations`, and `QuorumProof`)
* `TrustBundleCID` (Merkle-anchored content identifier)

### Structure

```json
TrustBundle {
  federation_did: DID,
  epoch: 0,
  metadata: FederationMetadata,
  quorum: GuardianQuorumConfig,
  members: [MembershipAttestation],
  credentials: [FederationEstablishmentCredential, GuardianRoleCredentials...],
  proof: QuorumProof { signatures: [...], config: ... }
}
```

## Phase 4: DAG Genesis & Anchoring

**Purpose:** Anchor the TrustBundle into the DAG-based cooperative memory structure, establishing verifiability and replayability.

### Steps

1. Create a DAG root node containing `TrustBundleCID`
2. Anchor the `TrustBundle` in federation node storage
3. Produce an `AnchorCredential` linking the DAG root to the TrustBundle

### Outputs

* `DAGGenesisNode` (CID linked to TrustBundle)
* `AnchorCredential` (VC asserting anchoring by node quorum)

---

## Phase 5: Receipt & Verification Protocol

**Purpose:** Define how third parties can verify the legitimacy of the federation genesis.

### Verification Flow

1. Resolve `FederationDID`
2. Retrieve `TrustBundle` from known DAG anchor or federation node
3. Verify `QuorumProof` (Guardian signatures)
4. Replay DAG anchor to confirm `TrustBundleCID`
5. Check `FederationEstablishmentCredential` against Guardian DIDs

### Optional

* Challenge-response to federation node using federation key
* Multi-party replay proofs across federations

---

## Phase 6: Key Recovery & Continuity

**Purpose:** Define procedures for federation key rotation, guardian succession, and recovery from loss.

### Protocols

* `GuardianRotationProposal` → Voted and anchored via DAG
* `FederationMetadataUpdate` → Must be signed by current quorum
* `DisasterRecoveryAnchor` → Out-of-band anchoring path for reconstituted federation

### Guarantees

* All updates are verifiably linked to the original genesis
* Guardian changes and quorum updates must be replayable via DAG

---

## Conclusion

The Federation Genesis Bootstrap process ensures that every federation in ICN starts from a cryptographically verifiable, human-legible, and politically legitimate foundation. The protocol balances rigor with flexibility—allowing for trust formation without centralized authorities, and anchoring federation identity in a way that is durable, transparent, and sovereign.

This specification is the canonical reference for federation formation and should be used to guide both implementation and evaluation of federated trust in the ICN system.
