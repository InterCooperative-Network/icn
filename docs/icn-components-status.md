# InterCooperative Network (ICN) Components Status

## Overview
The ICN codebase consists of three main components, each at a different stage of development and stability:

1. ✅ **Runtime (CoVM)**: Stable and functional
2. ⚠️ **Wallet**: Partially working with several issues
3. ❌ **Agoranet**: Non-functional with numerous critical issues

Here's a detailed breakdown of each component:

## ✅ Runtime (CoVM)
**Status: Functional/Stable**

The runtime component is in good shape and compiles successfully. It includes:
- Core WASM VM
- Identity management
- DAG implementation
- Storage interfaces
- Economics module

All critical crates in the runtime component pass `cargo check` and build successfully. There are some warnings about unused variables and imports, but these don't affect functionality.

**Next Steps:**
- Add comprehensive tests
- Clean up unused imports and variables
- Improve documentation

## ⚠️ Wallet
**Status: Partially Working**

The wallet component is partially functional but has significant issues:

**Working Components:**
- `wallet-core`: Compiles and runs
- `wallet-types`: Compiles and runs

**Problematic Components:**
- `wallet-sync`: Doesn't compile due to various type mismatches and dependency conflicts
- `wallet-agent`: Likely affected by similar issues as wallet-sync

**Key Issues:**
1. Version conflicts with multihash (0.16.3 vs 0.18.1)
2. Incorrect error handling in backoff error callbacks
3. Type mismatches in important structures:
   - DagNode.data type mismatch (Vec<u8> vs serde_json::Value)
   - DateTime/SystemTime conversion issues
   - NodeSubmissionResponse field name differences
4. Incompatible versions of shared dependencies with runtime

**Recommended Fixes:**
1. Rename dependencies to avoid version conflicts
2. Fix error handling and type conversions
3. Align data structures with runtime component

## ❌ Agoranet
**Status: Non-functional**

The Agoranet component doesn't compile and has many critical issues:

**Critical Issues:**
1. Missing database setup:
   - No `.env` file with DATABASE_URL
   - Missing SQLx migration info
2. Library version conflicts:
   - Multiple incompatible versions of Axum
   - libp2p version mismatches
3. Schema/OpenAPI documentation errors
4. Route handler signature mismatches
5. Missing message handling components

**Required for Running:**
1. Database setup:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:icnpass@localhost:5432/agoranet
   ```
2. Running database migrations:
   ```bash
   cargo sqlx database setup
   cargo sqlx migrate run
   ```
3. Fix version conflicts with dependencies
4. Complete missing API handlers

## Validation Tests Run
- Runtime: ✅ `cargo check -p icn-core-vm` - Success
- Wallet-sync: ❌ `cargo check -p wallet-sync` - 19 errors
- Agoranet: ❌ `cargo check -p icn-agoranet` - 77 errors

## Development Work Priority
1. Focus on fixing wallet-sync to connect with the functional runtime
2. Add simple CLI interfaces for testing wallet+runtime interaction
3. Defer Agoranet fixes until the runtime+wallet integration is stable
