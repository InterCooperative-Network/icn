# Distributed Storage

The Distributed Storage system of the ICN Runtime provides robust, secure, and cooperative-governed blob storage capabilities that underpin all persistent data needs of the platform.

## Core Concepts

### Storage Backend Abstraction

The storage system is built on a clean abstraction layer:
- Common interface for different storage implementations
- Transactional operations for consistency
- Content-addressed through CIDs (Content Identifiers)
- Pluggable backends allow for different deployment scenarios

Implementations include:
- In-memory storage (for testing and development)
- Local filesystem storage
- Distributed network storage
- IPFS integration
- Custom federation-specific backends

### Distributed Blob Storage

Distributed Blob Storage extends the basic storage backend:
- Content-addressable blobs with cryptographic verification
- Federation-wide replication based on policies
- Access control through identity verification
- Pinning capabilities for persistence guarantees

Key operations:
- `put_blob`: Store a new blob and retrieve its CID
- `get_blob`: Retrieve a blob by its CID
- `pin_blob`: Ensure a blob is preserved according to a policy
- `unpin_blob`: Release a blob from a specific preservation policy
- `blob_exists`: Check if a blob is available in the local or federation storage
- `replication_status`: Check how widely a blob is replicated

### Content Addressing

Content addressing ensures data integrity:
- CIDs uniquely identify content based on its hash
- Content cannot be altered without changing its identifier
- Verification is built into the addressing scheme
- Deduplication happens automatically

The ICN Runtime uses the same CID format as IPFS for compatibility, with:
- multihash for flexible hashing algorithms
- multicodec for content type identification
- multibase for encoding flexibility

### Replication Policies

Replication policies define how data is stored across the federation:
- **Fixed Factor**: Replicate to N specific nodes
- **Percentage**: Replicate to X% of available nodes
- **Geographic**: Ensure copies exist in specific regions
- **Contextual**: Replicate based on usage patterns and access frequency

Policies can be defined in CCL and are tied to governance processes, ensuring democratic control over data preservation.

## Federation Storage Integration

### Federation-wide Consensus

The storage system integrates with federation consensus:
- Critical data is anchored in trust bundles
- Replication commitments are enforced by federation agreements
- Validation of data availability across federation nodes
- Conflict resolution for divergent storage states

### Node Discovery and Health

Storage nodes participate in a dynamic mesh:
- Automatic discovery of available storage nodes
- Health checking and capacity reporting
- Load balancing across healthy nodes
- Graceful degradation when nodes are unavailable

### Blob Replication Protocol

The blob replication protocol ensures data persistence:
1. Node storing a blob announces its CID to the federation
2. Replication policy is consulted to determine target nodes
3. Target nodes request and verify the blob
4. Success/failure is reported to originating node
5. Periodic verification ensures continued availability

## Governance Integration

### Storage Constitutional Framework

Storage is governed through the ICN constitutional system:
- Resource allocation through participatory budgeting
- Access policies defined in community/cooperative governance
- Federation-level commitments to data preservation
- Guardian oversight for storage disputes

### Storage SLAs

Service Level Agreements for storage are encoded in CCL:
- Minimum replication factors
- Geographic distribution requirements
- Retrieval latency expectations
- Durability guarantees
- Remediation processes for violations

## Access Control

### Identity-based Access

Access to stored data is controlled through the identity system:
- Scoped access based on identity type
- Verifiable credentials determine read/write permissions
- Zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving verification
- Delegation capabilities for temporary access

### Encryption Support

The storage system supports encryption patterns:
- Client-side encryption for private data
- Shared encryption for group access
- Key rotation and revocation
- Threshold encryption for constitutional requirements

## Technical Implementation

### Storage Interface

The basic storage interface provides:
- Key-value operations with transactional support
- Binary blob storage with content addressing
- Metadata association with stored objects
- Querying capabilities for discovery

### Distributed Network Protocol

The distributed protocol is built on:
- libp2p for peer-to-peer communications
- Kademlia DHT for node discovery
- Bitswap-inspired protocol for blob exchange
- Gossipsub for federation announcements

## Performance Considerations

The system is optimized for:
- Fast retrieval of frequently accessed data
- Efficient verification of data integrity
- Bandwidth-conscious replication strategies
- Storage efficiency through deduplication

## Development Roadmap

The Distributed Storage development is prioritized in the following order:

1. Storage backend trait and in-memory implementation
2. Basic CID-based blob storage
3. Replication protocol between nodes
4. Policy-based replication rules
5. Access control integration with identity system
6. Federation consensus for storage commitments
7. Advanced features (garbage collection, caching, etc.)

## Examples

Storage operations in the ICN Runtime include:
- Storing governance records with high replication requirements
- Managing community media with appropriate access controls
- Preserving private credentials with encryption
- Federation-wide sharing of common resources
- Transient storage for work-in-progress collaboration
