# ICN Wallet Security Considerations

This document outlines security considerations for the ICN Wallet, including potential risks, mitigation strategies, and implementation recommendations.

## Private Key Management

### Risks
- **Private Key Exposure**: Unauthorized access to private keys could lead to identity theft, unauthorized transactions, or credential forgery.
- **Weak Key Generation**: Insufficient entropy during key generation could lead to predictable or weak keys.
- **Insecure Storage**: Keys stored in plaintext or with insufficient protection are vulnerable to theft.

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Secure Key Generation**
   - Use cryptographically secure random number generators
   - Ensure sufficient entropy for key generation
   - Implement key derivation functions with appropriate parameters

2. **Secure Storage**
   - Encrypt private keys at rest using industry-standard encryption (AES-256)
   - Use password-derived keys with strong key derivation functions (Argon2id)
   - Store sensitive data in platform-specific secure storage when available:
     - Android: Keystore
     - iOS: Keychain
     - Desktop: System keyring or encrypted file storage

3. **Key Usage Protection**
   - Require explicit user confirmation for all signing operations
   - Implement session timeouts for authorized key usage
   - Consider threshold signing for high-value operations

### Implementation Recommendations
- Review `wallet-core` key generation and storage mechanisms
- Add explicit entropy checks during key generation
- Implement key rotation capabilities
- Add secure memory handling to prevent key exposure in memory dumps

## Authentication & Authorization

### Risks
- **Unauthorized API Access**: Without proper authentication, unauthorized users could access wallet functions.
- **Missing Identity Validation**: Operations might be performed with invalid or unauthorized identities.
- **Session Management Flaws**: Improper session management could allow session hijacking.

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **API Authentication**
   - Implement authentication for all API endpoints
   - Use JWT or similar token-based authentication
   - Require re-authentication for sensitive operations

2. **Identity Validation**
   - Validate identity ownership before each operation
   - Verify signature chains for delegated operations
   - Implement proper DID resolution and verification

3. **Secure Session Management**
   - Generate cryptographically secure session identifiers
   - Implement proper session timeouts
   - Bind sessions to specific clients or IP addresses when appropriate

### Implementation Recommendations
- Add authentication middleware to the API server
- Implement a permissions model for different wallet operations
- Add session management with secure defaults

## Data Protection

### Risks
- **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Improper handling of sensitive data in logs, responses, or storage.
- **Insecure Communication**: Unencrypted or improperly secured communication channels.
- **Data Integrity Issues**: Tampering with stored data or in-transit messages.

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Data Encryption**
   - Encrypt all sensitive data at rest
   - Use TLS 1.3 for all network communications
   - Implement proper certificate validation

2. **Data Minimization**
   - Limit collection and storage of sensitive data
   - Implement purging policies for temporary data
   - Mask or truncate sensitive data in logs and error messages

3. **Integrity Protection**
   - Use cryptographic signatures to protect data integrity
   - Implement secure hash chains for sequential data
   - Verify signatures and hashes before processing data

### Implementation Recommendations
- Review and classify data sensitivity throughout the codebase
- Implement data protection for identified sensitive data
- Add logging filters to prevent sensitive data from appearing in logs

## Integration Points Security

### Risks
- **AgoraNet API Security**: Vulnerabilities in AgoraNet API integration.
- **Malicious Federation Peers**: Rogue peers providing falsified data.
- **Trust Bundle Tampering**: Unauthorized modifications to trust bundles.

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **API Security**
   - Validate all inputs from external APIs
   - Implement proper error handling for API failures
   - Use mutual TLS or API keys for service-to-service communication

2. **Federation Security**
   - Implement peer verification and authentication
   - Use cryptographic proofs for data integrity
   - Implement consensus mechanisms for critical data

3. **Trust Bundle Verification**
   - Cryptographically verify all trust bundles
   - Implement threshold signatures for trust bundle acceptance
   - Maintain an audit trail of trust bundle changes

### Implementation Recommendations
- Add input validation for all AgoraNet API responses
- Implement robust error handling for network failures
- Add signature verification for all federation data

## Error Handling & Logging

### Risks
- **Information Leakage**: Overly detailed error messages exposing sensitive information.
- **Insufficient Logging**: Inability to detect or investigate security incidents.
- **Log Injection**: Malicious input being reflected in logs leading to log forging.

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Secure Error Handling**
   - Implement sanitized, user-friendly error messages
   - Keep detailed error information in internal logs only
   - Prevent exceptions from revealing implementation details

2. **Security Logging**
   - Log all security-relevant events with appropriate detail
   - Include authentication events, signing operations, and data access
   - Implement proper log rotation and retention policies

3. **Log Protection**
   - Sanitize all user input before logging
   - Protect log integrity with cryptographic mechanisms
   - Implement centralized log collection for security monitoring

### Implementation Recommendations
- Review all error handling in `wallet-ui-api` to prevent information leakage
- Enhance logging throughout the codebase for security-relevant events
- Implement log sanitization to prevent log injection attacks

## Credential Management

### Risks
- **Credential Forgery**: Unauthorized creation of credentials.
- **Credential Disclosure**: Inappropriate sharing of credentials.
- **Revocation Bypass**: Using revoked credentials due to poor revocation checking.

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Credential Issuance Security**
   - Implement proper authorization for credential issuance
   - Use cryptographically secure credential formats
   - Include appropriate validity constraints and proofs

2. **Selective Disclosure**
   - Implement zero-knowledge proofs for credential disclosure
   - Support selective disclosure of credential attributes
   - Allow user control over what is shared

3. **Revocation Checking**
   - Implement robust credential status checking

### Implementation Recommendations
- Review credential issuance in `wallet-core` for proper authorization
- Implement selective disclosure protocols
- Add comprehensive revocation checking

## Input Validation
