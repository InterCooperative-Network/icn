# ICN Wallet Refactoring Summary

## Completed Refactoring

1. **Directory Renaming**
   - Renamed wallet crate directories to match their package names with `icn-` prefix
   - Created a backup of original directories to ensure no data was lost

2. **Duplicate Crate Removal**
   - Removed redundant wallet crates from `runtime/crates` directory
   - Preserved backups in case they're needed

3. **Import Path Updates**
   - Fixed import paths in Rust files to reference newly named modules
   - Added helper methods for compatibility with code using old structs

4. **Fixed Specific Issues in wallet-sync**
   - Corrected WalletError import to use SharedError from icn-wallet-types
   - Fixed field name changes (issuer → creator, payload → content, etc.)
   - Added compatibility layer for old code using previous field names
   - Added required dependencies (base64)
   - Fixed inner/outer doc comment issues
   - Implemented StreamExt properly for federation subscriber

5. **Dependency Management**
   - Updated path dependencies in Cargo.toml files to point to renamed directories
   - Fixed circular dependencies between components

## Remaining Warnings

The wallet components have some remaining warnings that do not affect functionality:
- Unused imports
- Unused variables
- Deprecated `base64::encode` function (should use `Engine::encode`)

## Other Components

The `icn-dag` crate and other components still have errors that need to be addressed separately. These components were not part of the wallet refactoring scope.

## Next Steps

1. Run `cargo fix --workspace --allow-dirty` to clean up remaining warnings
2. Run `cargo fmt --all` to ensure consistent code style
3. Run `cargo clippy --workspace --fix --allow-dirty` to fix any additional code issues
4. Consider adding the validation script to CI to enforce naming consistency
