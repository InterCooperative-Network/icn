# ICN Core-VM Refactoring Report

## Completed Changes

1. **Fixed Trap::new Usages**
   - Replaced all `Trap::new` with `Trap::throw` in host_abi.rs
   - This brings the error handling in line with wasmtime 12.0.2 requirements

## Verified No Changes Needed

1. **Memory Access Methods**
   - The `get_memory` function in mem_helpers.rs is already using the correct API
   - It uses `caller.get_export("memory")` directly rather than through `as_context_mut()`

2. **ConcreteHostEnvironment Clone Trait**
   - The `ConcreteHostEnvironment` struct already has the `#[derive(Clone)]` attribute

## Remaining Issues

1. **Fix DagNode Data Conversion**
   - The runtime's DAG node and wallet's DAG node have different structures
   - We need to work on the compat.rs file in wallet-sync to ensure proper conversion

2. **Fix Storage Manager Type Compatibility**
   - There appear to be issues with the Storage implementation
   - The StorageManager trait doesn't match its implementations

## Next Steps

1. Fix the type compatibility issues in the wallet-sync crate
2. Test runtime and wallet integration
3. Address any remaining dependency version conflicts
