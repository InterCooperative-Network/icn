# ICN Runtime Security Review & Hardening Plan

This document outlines the security review process and hardening plans for the ICN Runtime, particularly focusing on WASM execution, resource metering, and sandbox isolation.

## 1. Host ABI Memory Operations

### Security Concerns
- Guest-to-host buffer bounds checking
- Memory access validation
- Buffer overflow protection
- Integer overflow/underflow in memory operations
- UTF-8 validation for string parameters

### Audit Steps
- [ ] Review all memory access functions in `core-vm/src/host_abi.rs`
- [ ] Validate bounds checking in `safe_check_bounds` and `safe_read_bytes`
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling for all memory operations
- [ ] Verify UTF-8 validation in string operations
- [ ] Check for integer overflow/underflow in memory offset calculations

### Hardening Measures
- Implement strict bounds checking before all host memory access
- Add maximum buffer size constants and enforce them
- Replace unchecked arithmetic with checked or saturating operations
- Add detailed error logging for all memory access failures
- Use memory sanitizers during fuzzing

## 2. WASM Sandbox Hardening

### Security Concerns
- Syscall access from WASM modules
- Resource consumption (CPU, memory)
- Side-channel attacks
- Trapped execution
- Determinism across environments

### Audit Steps
- [ ] Review wasmtime configuration settings in `core-vm/src/lib.rs`
- [ ] Audit fuel metering implementation
- [ ] Verify memory limits are properly enforced
- [ ] Check for potential sandbox escape vectors
- [ ] Confirm isolation between different federation scopes

### Hardening Measures
- Apply restrictive wasmtime config with minimal capabilities
- Implement fine-grained metering for all resource types
- Enable bounds checking for all memory operations
- Enforce strict timeouts for WASM execution
- Implement proper isolation between federation execution contexts

## 3. Resource Authorization

### Security Concerns
- Resource limit bypass
- Authorization spoofing
- Accounting accuracy
- Economic security in cross-federation operations

### Audit Steps
- [ ] Review `host_check_resource_authorization` implementation
- [ ] Audit resource consumption tracking in all host functions
- [ ] Verify resource validation in cross-federation resource transfers
- [ ] Check for potential resource accounting errors

### Hardening Measures
- Apply strict resource caps for all operations
- Implement double-entry accounting for all resource operations
- Add detailed audit logs for all resource authorizations
- Ensure atomicity in resource consumption operations
- Verify all resource operations are properly anchored to DAG

## 4. DAG Anchoring & Replay

### Security Concerns
- Anchor tampering
- Replay attacks
- CID validation
- Signature verification
- Dependency validation

### Audit Steps
- [ ] Review `host_anchor_to_dag` and `host_store_node` implementations
- [ ] Verify signature validation in DAG operations
- [ ] Check parent dependency validation
- [ ] Audit merkle root calculation
- [ ] Verify replay determinism

### Hardening Measures
- Implement strict signature verification for all anchors
- Add detailed audit logging for all DAG operations
- Ensure proper parent dependency validation
- Implement DAG auditor for replay verification
- Add Merkle proof generation for all anchors

## 5. Credential Issuance

### Security Concerns
- Unauthorized credential issuance
- Invalid credential signatures
- Credential revocation bypass
- Federation scope leakage

### Audit Steps
- [ ] Review credential issuance functions
- [ ] Verify signature generation and validation
- [ ] Check federation scope enforcement
- [ ] Audit credential revocation mechanisms

### Hardening Measures
- Implement strict authorization checks for credential operations
- Add detailed audit logging for all credential issuance
- Ensure proper federation scope isolation
- Implement credential status verification
- Add federation-wide credential synchronization validation

## 6. Fuzzing Harness

### Target Areas
- Host ABI functions
- Memory operations
- Resource authorization checks
- DAG anchoring functions
- Credential operations

### Fuzzing Approach
- Use `cargo-fuzz` with coverage-guided fuzzing
- Focus on input validation and memory safety
- Test resource limit edge cases
- Fuzz cross-federation operations
- Test concurrent operations

### Implementation Plan
- [ ] Set up `cargo-fuzz` infrastructure
- [ ] Implement fuzz targets for host ABI functions
- [ ] Create corpus of valid and invalid inputs
- [ ] Automate fuzzing as part of CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Create reproducers for any identified issues

## 7. Monitoring & Observability

### Requirements
- Detailed logging of all security-sensitive operations
- Resource consumption tracking
- Execution anomaly detection
- Prometheus metrics for security monitoring
- Alerting for potential security issues

### Implementation Plan
- [ ] Implement RuntimeMonitor for all operations
- [ ] Add detailed security logging
- [ ] Configure Prometheus metrics for security monitoring
- [ ] Set up anomaly detection for resource consumption
- [ ] Implement alerting for potential security issues

## Security Release Process

1. **Issue Identification**: Document the security issue with severity assessment
2. **Containment**: Implement temporary measures to mitigate the issue
3. **Fix Development**: Create patch with security tests
4. **Review**: Perform thorough security review of the patch
5. **Testing**: Run fuzzing and security tests on the patch
6. **Release**: Prepare coordinated release with clear communication
7. **Post-Mortem**: Document lessons learned and improve security process
