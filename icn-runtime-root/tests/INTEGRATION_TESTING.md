# ICN Runtime Integration Testing Improvements

This document summarizes the changes made to prepare the ICN Runtime for automated integration testing. These improvements enable reliable, deterministic testing of the ICN Runtime in an integrated environment with AgoraNet and Wallet components.

## 1. Docker Compose Configuration (Stability)

The `docker-compose.integration.yml` file has been enhanced to provide a stable container environment:

- **Fixed Ports**: Consistent port mapping for HTTP API (8080), WebSocket events (8090), libp2p (4001), and metrics (9090)
- **Health Checks**: Added health checks to all services to ensure readiness before test execution
- **Startup Order**: Configured inter-service dependencies with health check conditions
- **Restart Policies**: Added appropriate restart policies for resilience during testing
- **Volume Configuration**: Enhanced volume mounts with proper read-only flags where appropriate
- **Structured Logging**: Configured JSON log format for easier parsing in automated tests

## 2. State Query API (Observability)

Added a debug API module that provides read-only access to internal state for testing and verification:

- **Federation Status**: Query information about the current federation state
- **Proposal Status**: Check the status of proposals by their CID
- **DAG Inspection**: Query the content and metadata of DAG nodes
- **Peer Information**: List connected peers in the federation

These endpoints are accessible under `/api/v1/debug/` and return JSON responses that can be parsed by automated test scripts.

## 3. Event Monitoring (Verification)

Created a WebSocket monitoring script to verify events emitted by the ICN Runtime:

- **Wait Capability**: Can wait for specific event types with timeout
- **Filtering**: Supports filtering events by type
- **Logging**: Logs events to file for later analysis
- **Exit Codes**: Returns appropriate exit codes for use in testing scripts

This enables test scripts to verify that expected events are emitted when certain actions are performed.

## 4. State Management (Test Isolation)

Added a state reset script to ensure clean test environments between test runs:

- **Full Reset**: Can completely clear runtime state
- **Partial Reset**: Can selectively preserve certain state (like keys)
- **Backup**: Optionally creates backups before reset
- **Configurability**: Supports custom data and log directories

## 5. Utility Scripts (Workflow Support)

- **wait_for_services.sh**: Pauses execution until all services are healthy
- **verify_debug_api.sh**: Validates that debug API endpoints are accessible
- **websocket_monitor.js**: Monitors and verifies WebSocket event emission

## Integration Test Workflow

With these improvements, the recommended integration test workflow is:

1. Start containers with Docker Compose
2. Wait for all services to be healthy
3. Reset state as needed
4. Execute test actions against the Runtime
5. Verify results through:
   - Debug API for state verification
   - WebSocket events for event-driven verification
   - Log inspection for detailed troubleshooting

## Next Steps and Future Improvements

1. **Mock Services**: Develop mock AgoraNet and Wallet services for more isolated testing
2. **Test Framework**: Create a full test framework that leverages these tools
3. **CI Integration**: Set up CI pipelines to run integration tests automatically
4. **Benchmark Tests**: Add performance benchmark tests using these facilities
5. **Chaos Testing**: Add support for chaos testing (network failures, container restarts)
