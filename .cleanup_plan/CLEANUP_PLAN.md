# ICN Repository Cleanup and Organization Plan

## 1. Repository Structure Standardization

### 1.1 Define a consistent monorepo structure
- Standardize on a single Cargo workspace structure
- Move all components under a unified workspace
- Establish common development tooling

### 1.2 Component organization
- Organize by functional area:
  - `crates/runtime` - Core runtime components
  - `crates/wallet` - Wallet components
  - `crates/agoranet` - Network and deliberation components
  - `crates/mesh` - Mesh compute components
  - `crates/common` - Shared libraries and utilities

## 2. Code Consolidation and Deduplication

### 2.1 Common types and utilities
- Identify and consolidate duplicate type definitions
- Create shared utility libraries for common functionality
- Standardize error handling patterns

### 2.2 Interface standardization
- Define stable interfaces between major components
- Implement consistent serialization and communication protocols
- Document API contracts

## 3. Documentation Improvements

### 3.1 API documentation
- Ensure all public interfaces have proper documentation
- Create examples for key APIs
- Add module-level documentation for each crate

### 3.2 Architecture documentation
- Consolidate existing documentation
- Create visual diagrams for system architecture
- Document integration points between components

## 4. Build and Test Infrastructure

### 4.1 Unified build system
- Create consolidated build scripts
- Standardize CI/CD pipeline
- Implement consistent versioning strategy

### 4.2 Test coverage
- Add integration tests for component boundaries
- Ensure unit test coverage for core functionality
- Implement end-to-end testing

## 5. Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Structure Reorganization
1. Create new directory structure
2. Migrate existing code to new structure
3. Update Cargo.toml files to reflect new organization

### Phase 2: Code Consolidation
1. Identify duplicate code across components
2. Extract shared libraries
3. Refactor components to use shared libraries

### Phase 3: Documentation and Testing
1. Update documentation to reflect new structure
2. Add missing API documentation
3. Enhance test coverage

### Phase 4: Build System
1. Create unified build scripts
2. Implement development tooling
3. Set up CI/CD pipeline

## 6. Migration Strategy

### 6.1 Incremental approach
- Implement changes component by component
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition
- Validate each step before proceeding

### 6.2 Version control strategy
- Create feature branches for each phase
- Regular integration to main branch
- Maintain detailed commit history

## 7. Timeline and Milestones

- Phase 1 (Structure): Complete in 1-2 days
- Phase 2 (Consolidation): Complete in 2-3 days
- Phase 3 (Documentation): Complete in 1-2 days
- Phase 4 (Build System): Complete in 1-2 days

Total estimated time: 5-9 days
